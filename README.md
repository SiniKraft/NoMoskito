NoMoskito! is a game developed in [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in which you try to survive by killing "moskitoes" (a special type of mosquitoes, bigger but weak to heat)  
Your mouse pointer become a swatter to kill them all !  
Try to keep enough blood to live the longer time possible !
You can even play with a controller (motion capture not available for now) - play with a stick and buttons !

Enjoy a game without ads, which doesn't sell your data, 100% free and (a little) optimized !
